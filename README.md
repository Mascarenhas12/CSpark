Project's motivation:
  Chess position evaluations are based the best possible moves that engines can foresee 
  which leads innacurate evaluations for humans playing, especially when it is a timed match.
  This engine evaluation is more and more accurate as the player's skill increases and becomes a master, 
  however it's radically innacurate when it comes to the "average Joe".
  Furthermore, to the intermmediate player there might be confusion when they see the evaluation when there
  is no "apparent" mistake (i.e equal material and pieces) in the engine line's provided until a unreasonable
  ammount of moves for their rating.
